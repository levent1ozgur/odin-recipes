    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fava beans sauteed with onions. A traditional Turkish dish. Served at room temperature with garlic yogurt.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds fresh fava beans, shelled </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li> salt to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh dill</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>   Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss in fava beans and cook until slightly tender, about 2 minutes.  </li>
        <li>  Cut the dough into four portions. Shape the dough into rounds and flatten each round as though you're making pizza dough. Cover the rounds with a damp cloth and let the dough rest for 15 minutes. </li>
        <li> Mix 2 tablespoons water and flour together in a bowl; pour into the fava bean mixture. Add 1 cup water, lemon juice, sugar, and salt. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until fava beans are very tender, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Stir dill into the fava bean mixture; continue simmering until flavors are combined, about 2 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. </li>
    </ol>
