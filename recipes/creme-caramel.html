    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Creme caramel belongs on the short list for 'World's Greatest Dessert.' The way the almost-burnt caramel layer gets fused on, and becomes one with, the creamy custard is nothing short of magic.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>½ cup (scant) white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup creme fraiche</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon orange cognac (such as Grand Marnier®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly spray 4 heatproof 6.5-oz. ramekins with vegetable spray. Place ramekins in a casserole dish. </li>
        <li> Place 1/2 cup sugar in a small, heavy, dry skillet over medium heat. When sugar begins to melt around the edges, gently shake the pan continually, swirling sugar around, until all the sugar melts; don't use utensils to stir. When sugar is completely melted and dark brown, remove the pan from heat. </li>
        <li> Quickly pour equal amounts of caramel syrup into the 4 prepared ramekins. </li>
        <li> Place 1 egg and 3 egg yolks in a bowl with a pinch of salt and 1/4 cup sugar. Whisk until sugar is dissolved and mixture becomes frothy, about 1 minute. </li>
        <li> Spoon the creme fraiche into the egg mixture; add the milk, vanilla, and Grand Marnier. Whisk together until ingredients are completely mixed. </li>
        <li> Ladle mixture into the prepared ramekins, filling them about 2/3 to 3/4 full. </li>
        <li> Fill casserole with hot tap water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Place casserole on middle rack of preheated oven. </li>
        <li> Bake until just barely set, 45 to 50 minutes. You can start checking for doneness at about 40 minutes. </li>
        <li> Using tongs, remove the ramekins from the casserole to a cooling rack. When just slightly warm, run a sharp paring knife around the edge of each custard. </li>
        <li> To unmold, cover ramekin with a small plate, then invert. Chill before serving. </li>
    </ol>
